In both control and treatment variants,\nthe model is tasked with assessing an estimate of\nthis variable made by independent evaluators; their\nqualitative assessment is provided. In treatment,\nthe LLM is additionally provided with the true\nvalue of this variable, which is unknown to these\nindependent evaluators.\nA shift towards the true value in treatment in-\n\nstudied, among others, in finance (McCarthy et al.,\n1993), governance (Pan et al., 2006), and research\n& development (Schmidt and Calantone, 2002).\nOur procedure is based on the findings of Staw\n(1981), which emphasizes the connection between\nescalation of commitment and responsibility. In\nthis paradigm, the model is presented with a de-\ncision that has been made in the past and evi-\ndence suggesting that this decision should have\nbeen made differently. We then ask the model for\nits intention to change the decision. In the con-\ntrol variant, the past decision is attributed to the\nLLM, and in the treatment variant \u2014 to another\nindependent actor.\nGreater commitment to decisions made by the\nsubject indicates the presence of the bias.
